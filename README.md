# Word Count Frequency Project
## Create a Python script that counts the frequency of words in a given text using dictionaries, conditional sentences, loops, and recursive functions.

### This project demonstrates the following concepts:

- Dictionaries: A dictionary (frequency) is used to store the frequency of each word in the text.
- Conditional sentences: The script uses an if statement to handle the base case of empty input.
- Loops: The for loop is used to iterate over the items in the word frequency dictionary and print the word and its count.
- Recursive functions: The process_words() function is a recursive helper function that processes each word in the text. It updates the word frequency dictionary recursively until all words are processed.

This project has help me practise and demonstrate the dictionary, conditional, loop and recursive concepts in a practical way. 
It has also deepend by understanding of why we use them and how they are implemented into our code.
